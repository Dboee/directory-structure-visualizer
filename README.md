# Directory Structure Visualizer

This repository contains a powerful shell script that visualizes the directory structure of your projects. It's a great tool for developers who want to quickly understand the layout of a new project or share their project structure with others.

## Features

- Visualizes the directory structure in a clear, easy-to-understand format.
- Supports `.gitignore` files, so you can exclude certain files and directories from the visualization.
- Allows you to control the depth of the directory traversal, so you can focus on the parts of the structure that matter most to you.
- Defaults to the current directory if no directory is specified, making it easy to use in any project.

## Usage

To use the script, simply run it with the directory you want to visualize as an argument:

```
bash print_hierarchy.sh
